                <h2>What Are Penguins?</h2>
                <p>Penguins are a group of <span class="highlight">aquatic flightless birds</span> that are highly adapted to life in the water. These remarkable creatures are found exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with the exception of penguins found near the equator on the Galápagos Islands. They are known for their distinctive black and white plumage, which provides excellent camouflage in their marine environment.</p>

                <h2>Reproduction and Parenting</h2>
                <p>Penguins are monogamous birds that demonstrate remarkable parental dedication. Emperor Penguins are particularly famous for their extreme breeding cycles and parental commitment in the harshest environment on Earth.</p>
                
                <p>Most penguin species breed during the austral spring and summer. <span class="highlight">Both parents</span> share the responsibility of egg incubation and chick care. Eggs typically hatch within 35-40 days, and chicks are born covered in fluffy down feathers. Parents take turns feeding their young by regurgitating partially digested food until the chicks are ready to fledge, usually after 2-3 months.</p>
